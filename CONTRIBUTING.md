# How to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) using [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
3. Commit & push. "Do what you want to do".
2. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of the maintainer.
